STL files for 3D printing.  
I've designed parts using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).  

### Plate Base
I've added two plate bases which have different cavity for the servo: one large 40.6mm and the other large 41.2mm. Normally, standard servos are large 40mm, so the first one, 40.6mm. is suitable for servos like the Hi-tech that respect measures (consider also tolerances from 3D-Printer). I've found that some other servos, such as the XQPower I use, are slightly larger (about 40.8mm) and can't fit in the previous cavity, so I made a new cavity of 41.2mm and now the XQPower ones fits perfectly. So measure your servo width first than print. In case of doubt, print the 41.2mm.
  
### Wheels  
Wheels are generated with [Openscad](https://www.openscad.org/) using [Obijuan script](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19940) "Servo Wheel" on Thingiverse. You can found the script also on his [Github Repo for Miniskybot](https://github.com/Obijuan/Miniskybot/)

### Models
Arduino model, used for sizing and holes, is from [cmspooner on Thingiverse](https://www.openscad.org/)
