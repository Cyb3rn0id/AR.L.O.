# AR.L.O.
AR.L.O. Stands for ARduino Loaded with O-rings! It's an educational Arduino-based robot with a chassis printed in 3D. It features an ultrasonic range finder SR-HC04, an 0.91" OLED display, an HC-05 or HC-06 Bluetooth Module and two modified Servos (MG996R) for moving around.  I provided full-assembly instructions on my blog (see link at the end of this readme). Here you can find the STL to be printed and a source code.  Source code uses interrupts for make robot movement more efficient.
